# MV3 Iframe

This repository showcases different types to load external code to a MV3 Chrome extension.

Check [./gmail](./src/gmail.js) for more info.

## Get started

This project kickstarts a server on localhost:8080 to serve as an external domain.

> npm start

Then, you can "Load unpacked" the root folder as a Chrome Extension.

To test the MV2, rename the `manifest-v2.json` to `manifest.json`.
